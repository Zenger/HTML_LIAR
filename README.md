HTML_LIAR
=========

This is intended to be a project which will help you encode your html in a HTML/CSS template.

It's intended to enode the HTML, removing all new lines, renaming all the clasess (along with the CSS file). Minify and replace CSS and minify and redo Javascript so it won't make any sense. 

You can't hide your HTML, because the browser should recieve a normal HTML anyway, so a user could steal it. But it's very hard and pointless to use a HTML template which has no sense.

If you have questions/ideeas write me.

Thanks
